.SH DESCRIPTION
.B isa-top
shows transfer speeds in human-readable format for individual communicating ip addresses.
Program uses libcap library to capture packets from network interface which requires \fIroot\fR privileges.
The connections are stored in the map including information about the number of bytes transferred in the last interval.
Connections are displayed using ncurses library and updated in a given refresh interval. Program will not display more than 10 active connections at a time.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-i\fR \fIinterface\fR
Specify the network interface on which the packets will be captured. This option is mandatory. Examples of interfaces could be \fBeth0\fR, \fBwlan0\fR.
If you are not sure about the available interfaces, you can use [\fB\-h\fR] option to list them.
.TP
[\fB\-s\fR \fIb\fR|\fIp\fR]
Specify parameter based on which the connections will be sorted. When option not specified, the connections are sorted by the number of bytes transferred in the last interval.

\fIb\fR - sort by the number of bytes transferred in the last interval.

\fIp\fR - sort by the number of packets transferred in the last interval.
.TP
[\fB\-t\fR \fIseconds\fR]
Specify the refresh interval in seconds. When not specified, default value is 1 second.
.TP
[\fB\-h\fR]
Shows usage message of the program.
.TP
[\fB\-l\fR]
List all available network interfaces.

.SH EXAMPLES

.TP
Run isa-top on the eth0 interface and sort connections by packets transferred:
.B
isa-top -i eth0 -s p

.TP
Run isa-top and list all available network interfaces:
.B
isa-top -l

.TP
Run isa-top on loopback interface and set refresh interval to 2 seconds:
.B
isa-top -i lo -t 2
